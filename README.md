Pretty much needed to build a coding quiz with

- multiple choice questions
- timer
- stores high scores
- compare scores on a high score list

The criteria needed for quiz

- quiz starts and timer start after clicking the start button
- question will appear and user will have 60 seconds to complete quiz.
- if user answers correct, 10 pts are added to score; then goes on to next question.
- if user answers incorrectly, timer is reduced by 5 seconds, then goes on to next question.
- if all questions are answered or timer reaches 0 the game is over.
- once the game is over, user receives scores and input initals and will sumbit it and will appear on high scores list.

This assignment was really hard. I felt like I spent over 20 hours trying to problem solve and finish this. I came coming across a ton of issues/errors.
I ended up getting stuck after completing the quiz. The submit button wouldn't console.log so I knew I wouldn't be able to put it in local storage. Which I was not able to create an updated high score page. 

Another issue I had was after completing the quiz, the game would refresh after the submit button.
So I was not able to finish this assignment. After finally figuring out how to use the event.preventdefault function, I was able to prevent the game from refreshing.
