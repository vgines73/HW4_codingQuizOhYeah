# HW4_codingQuizOhYeah
Pretty much needed to build a coding quiz with

- multiple choice questions
- timer
- stores high scores
- compare scores on a high score list

The criteria needed for quiz

- quiz starts and timer start after clicking the start button
- question will appear and user will have 60 seconds to complete quiz.
- if user answers correct, 10 pts are added to score; then goes on to next question.
- if user answers incorrectly, timer is reduced by 5 seconds, then goes on to next question.
- if all questions are answered or timer reaches 0 the game is over.
- once the game is over, user receives scores and input initals and will sumbit it and will appear on high scores list.
